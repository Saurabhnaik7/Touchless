Touchless - A Speech Recognition System for Elevators

To avoid the spread of the pandemic in the elevators , we have designing a system which is touchless and will be operated by speech commands.

This research will make the design of elevators that can be helpful for persons with disabilities, namely elevators controlled by voice.
Disability is someone who does not have a complete hand organ or hand organs but does not function properly, but the person can still use 
voice to control the elevator. The research combines speech recognition technology with electronic control technology used to make the
elevator control equipment that can be controlled by voice. Speech Recognition is a system that functions to convert spoken language into the input data. 


The system input is human speech. The system will identify spoken words to input data for control equipment. Control of this equipment requires a simple
word and can only recognize some words. These systems are usually more accurate and more easily trained, but could not recognize words that are beyond 
vocabulary ever taught. 

Languages used: Python
